hammock-gitlab-issues
=====================

A basic plugin to handle Hammock integration with Gitlab issue notifications 

##Installation

* `git clone https://github.com/poolski/hammock-gitlab-issues.git` inside your `$HAMMOCK_ROOT/plugins/` directory
* You'll need to `chown -R www-data:www-data .` inside your /plugins/ dir to ensure hammock-gitlab-issues has the right permissions and is readable by your web server

It should *just work* out the box. If not, please open an issue here
